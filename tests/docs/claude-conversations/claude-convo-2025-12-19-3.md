[Image #1]No this is not correct we had this working effectively and easily please fix. If you can't get it working in Safari make sure it works as a progressive web app. You should only need to ask for permission the first time you download it after that maintain that token and make sure you automatically update the permission or if you need to get the permission but it should work every time flawlessly without fail.

Fix this now We one hundred percent know that it worked because we had it working in version one and version two so there's zero reason it shouldn't be working now I want you to hear me very clearly and I need you to fix this

[Image #1] [Image #2] [Image #3] So once again, somehow you've got the microphone still broken. I'm being asked to click not once, but twice to get it working, and then rather than going working, I just get an error saying it didn't work and try the microphone, tap the microphone to try again. I really, really, really need you to get this working, and I really need you to diagnose and fix this and be a hundred percent sure it's working.

I'm getting really frustrated that you're going back and forth on this. Diagnose it carefully, figure out exactly what the right answer is. If you need to, do research on how to use microphones and progressive web apps and iOS, but get this working now
