[Image #1]No this is not correct we had this working effectively and easily please fix. If you can't get it working in Safari make sure it works as a progressive web app. You should only need to ask for permission the first time you download it after that maintain that token and make sure you automatically update the permission or if you need to get the permission but it should work every time flawlessly without fail.

Fix this now We one hundred percent know that it worked because we had it working in version one and version two so there's zero reason it shouldn't be working now I want you to hear me very clearly and I need you to fix this
