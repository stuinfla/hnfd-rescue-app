Now give them a way to share it with another location and have the other location go through an onboarding process that you build that sets up and captures all the things you need to from them that then sets up the files and folders and structures and names and everything that you need to do that.

Can you build that out 


## Human

yes

Okay. I want you to test this fully. How complete is it? And can you build me a simple data loader that they could also use? Give me an Excel format that they could use, that they could upload the file that you could read, and that'd be a hell of a lot easier than somebody having to go through the whole thing interactively and putting in twenty, thirty, fifty, seventy pieces of equipment
