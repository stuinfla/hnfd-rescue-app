And it would also be helpful on the admin section on the phone if you could also include the images at the bottom. So once I select the equipment, you should have the three options for the images at the bottom, and then the automated GIF that shows wh-what happens when people want to know where they're at, how to find it, and what it looks like.

And then also add the section in there so that the edit equipment section on the phone has the same information as whatever you just added on the admin page. They should both use the same storage and the same JSON values, or however you're storing that information, so that they all have the same fields and the same information.

So please check to make sure that you can do so. That way we don't have any inconsistencies. If somebody chooses to quickly use the admin section on the phone, it shouldn't mess anything up. It should essentially edit the exact same information that the admin section on the computer would do.

Please verify that and let me know
