Okay so at this point you know what it is we're trying to do with the application. Please review the admin page and give me recommendations that you think we should add to make it more functional, more usable. Assume the users using it are very non-technical folks and try to make that as easy as possible.

It would be great if they had a way to simply upload images from their iPhone

[Image #1]First fix this issue. The microphone is getting blocked. Whatever you need to get in terms of a microphone approval, ask for it once whenever the application is first downloaded and then store it in a way that you'd never have to ask the user for it again. If possible ask the user for it while they're in the browser and just set it up that way so that it automatically has that.

If you can't do that because of legal or iOS rules reasons for protection then minimize the number of times you need to do it but be sure you need to only do it once And verify that it is done and worked and is correct have the application be smart enough to confirm it has the approvals it needs and if not to make sure that it asks until it gets it I never want to see issues like this where it's saying that the microphone is blocked to me that would mean that you hadn't done your job

Nope. I'm on some sort of repeat thing where every time it says there's an update it asks me to accept it. Don't ask me to accept it. Just assume if there's an update that I want it updated. Go ahead and do it and then confirm that the update works.

So far you have me in a repeated loop where every time I say there's an update to version two dot eight dot seven and I say, "Okay," it turns around and gives me the same note two seconds later So like I said verify that the updates are there verify that they're working and if not find a way to elegantly fix it

Please make sure you're checking the application and you're running a test on it via Playwright every time before you show it to me. This is the fourth time you've made a mistake and told me you'd fix something. As you can see here, whatever you did now the microphone is still broken, and when I click on the Browse All Equipment, I expect it to immediately show me four or five lines of the equipment in alphabetical order that I can simply scroll through and, and click on one and hit Select, and it then immediately pulls it up, and that's still not working.

So you had two things to fix. Carefully fix them and test in Playwright to make sure that they both work properly
