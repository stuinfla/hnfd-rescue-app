Okay I'm really getting quite frustrated with you that the speech part isn't working I've given you like six tries I need you to seriously bring out the troubleshooting agent I need you to look at everything having to do with the speech I need you to see if there are parallel pieces of code or truncated pieces of code but whatever you need to do I need you to rip it apart and I need you to make it work and I mean now I am furious I am frustrated I am out of patience
