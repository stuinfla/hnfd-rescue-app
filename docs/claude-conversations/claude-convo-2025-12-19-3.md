when youa re done with this fix, verify it works.  then please check the UX design on the admin use in the iPhone version. It was showing me all the details for an item, but I couldn't actually scroll through anything or get to the bottom or there was no backup key or X key to X out of just editing that item and I needed that

Also you have this thing where there's this white modal window that comes up and asks me if I wanna do an upgrade. Don't ask me if I wanna do an upgrade. When there's a new version automatically pull the upgrade. You can do a quick modal window and show me I did it and or if you need to when a new upgrade comes out you can re-request the volume permissions.

But right now you're asking me to do an upgrade and then you're asking me again to do the upgrade and neither one of those is required. When there's an upgrade just perform it. Understood ?

Also when it comes time to look for the three image sequence for the locator that should be full screen so that I can see the images full or at least shrink the images down so that they're the full image not just a section of the image. That has the same problem you had before where you were showing me only pieces of an image and that's not acceptable

Whenever I speak to it I expect it to tell me back the answer. For some reason that stopped happening. Whenever you take the input and you understand what it is you need to absolutely read back the answer as to where I find it and then anything else I need to know about it.

Please fix
